            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently in my final year at CGC University, pursuing my Bachelor's degree. I enjoy learning how technology can be used to build beautiful and user-friendly websites. During my studies, I have developed skills in HTML, CSS, and basic design principles. When I'm not studying, I enjoy photography and exploring the rich culture of Punjab.
